# Calculator App
This is my repository for a Java GUI Calculator which I created using IntelliJ with Java. Users can utilize this calculator to conduct basic arithmetic computations.

## Implementation of Core Java/Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
**GUI Programming**
  - This app utilizes Java swing components like JFrame, JTextFields, and JButtons.
  - This app uses various actionListeners to perform actions when a button is clicked.

**Inheritance**
  - The concept of inheritance was implicitly used when I **implemented** the ActionListener class
